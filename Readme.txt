Hi!
This was probably my first project ever using python. I created this simple pong game using turtle and by following
a youtube tutorial. Turtle doesn't have it's own buttons classes built it so I had to find a way to know when the 
mouse is ontro the button and when this one is being clicked. The results weren't exacly what I expected but I was 
extremenly proud of how I managed to create them even though they didn't work as planned.
